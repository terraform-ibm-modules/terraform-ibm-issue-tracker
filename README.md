The information that's requested in the templates helps us resolve issues faster.

## Report an issue

1.  Use this issue tracker repository for issues that span modules. You can report issues for a single module from the GitHub issues page of that repository.
1.  Try your issue against the code in the most recent release in the repository.
1.  [Check](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues) for similar issues.

    If you can reproduce the issue and find a closed issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, link to the closed issue in the body of your issue.
1.  Use the [bug report](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug+%F0%9F%90%9E&template=bug_report.md) template to report an issue.
